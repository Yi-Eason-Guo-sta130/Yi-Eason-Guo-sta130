    "After receiving line-by-line code explanations from Chatgpt for the Tutorial Monte Hall problem, I found it easier to understand the conceptual process within the shorter code provided. I believe that using the chatbot technology helps us filter out all of the useless material. and organize all the important data we need on the internet, directing us to the correct thought process and course to take. Overall, I believe that the tool helps us comprehend the code in a very short period of time, as opposed to the previous practice of posting on the internet or any online forum and waiting for responses. Alternatively, you might spend a lot of time doing more research using search engines."
